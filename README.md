# hypergraph
`hypergraph` is an experiment roughly based on [this article by Stephen Wolfram](https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2020/04/finally-we-may-have-a-path-to-the-fundamental-theory-of-physics-and-its-beautiful/). It supports outputting Sigma.js-compatible JSON representations of hypergraphs.

This project illustrates the concept of applying simple rules to relation sets to produce highly complex outputs. Wolfram's project shows that this system can generate hypergraphs which are structurally analogous to many fundamental properties of physics. If I read the article right.
If you had infinite computing power and a lot of time on your hands to find the correct rule and starting condition, you could probably simulate the universe.

Rule-based transformations currently WIP.
